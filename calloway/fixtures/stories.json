"story": "\n\n<p>\nThe State of the Union address may be going the way of the NFL's Super Bowl, another January tradition that has become a February fixture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo date has been set for the president's annual address to Congress, but with Democrats hoping for a health care bill in hand first, the affair could be pushed until the first week in February or later &#8212; marking the latest date for a standard address in modern history.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Soon\" was the short answer that White House press secretary Robert Gibbs gave reporters last week, though he helpfully ruled out Feb. 2, the Tuesday that ABC is supposed to air the final season premiere of its show \"Lost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't foresee a scenario in which millions of people who hope to finally get some conclusion with 'Lost' are pre-empted by the president,\" he assured ABC's reporters at his daily briefing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nState of the Union dates have been slipping steadily. In the 1930s, the president gave his annual address to Congress during the first week in January. By the 1960s, that had slipped to the second week, and by the 1980s, it was regularly hitting the end of January.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis year, Mr. Obama's search for a date stems from the White House's desire to have a major legislative accomplishment to tout &#8212; in this case, health care.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSteffen W. Schmidt, known as \"Dr. Politics,\" said Mr. Obama needs to have a pony before he can have a dog-and-pony show.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\"You and I and everybody else knows why, and that's that you kind of want to at least have gotten something from health care reform out there so you have bragging points,\" said Mr. Schmidt, a professor of political science at Iowa State University and host of the state public radio's \"Dr. Politics\" program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Gibbs denied that the timing is tied to the legislative agenda, but he didn't say anything more about the considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Constitution requires the president to periodically deliver a report to Congress about the state of the nation. Presidents Washington and John Adams gave theirs in person annually, but Thomas Jefferson submitted his in writing &#8212; a tradition that lasted until President Wilson returned to delivering the speech in person.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe address typically is timed to the beginning of the year's legislative session. With Congress opening its session later each year, the date of the presidential address has slipped, too, said Betty K. Koed, associate historian for the Senate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresident Roosevelt delivered his State of the Union address on Jan. 3 in 1934, Jan. 4 in 1935 and Jan. 3 in 1936. By President Kennedy's administration, it had slipped to Jan. 30 in 1961, Jan. 11 in 1962 and Jan. 14 in 1963. President Reagan delivered all of his State of the Union addresses during the last week in January or later.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nComplicating matters, newly inaugurated &#8212; or re-inaugurated &#8212; presidents often delivered both an inaugural address on Jan. 20 and a later address to Congress, which occasionally slipped into February. President Obama's address to Congress last year was on Feb. 24, the latest ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn 1986, Mr. Reagan delivered his address on Feb. 4. The date was delayed a week because of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion in late January.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe speech has become a chance for the president to give marching orders to Congress at the beginning of each session. Mr. Schmidt said waiting too long can be dangerous \"because Congress will already start doing its mischief on its own.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut, he said, Mr. Obama has already had great success in bending Congress to his will, so his speech this year will be less of an agenda setter and more of a chance to tout action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCongress has to extend an invitation to the president, though it does so in consultation with the White House, which seems firmly in control of the decision this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn recent years, it's been tradition to deliver the address in the middle of the week. Gerhard Peters, co-founder of the American Presidency Project, said that's because Congress usually works Tuesday through Thursday. Lawmakers must be in session to receive the president.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Peters also said presidents are more likely now to try to avoid conflicts with TV networks' scheduling, such as the premiere of \"Lost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's funny, but it's also a very important point,\" he said. \"The president's ability to use television to connect with the public really sort of peaked by the '70s and '80s. Now with cable television and especially the Internet, we can distract ourselves so easily.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd indeed, the ratings have been erratic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe last regular State of the Union, President Bush's 2008 address, drew 37.5 million viewers, while Mr. Obama's own post-inaugural address last year garnered 52.4 million. Mr. Bush's 2003 address, which preceded the Iraq war, drew an audience of 62.1 million.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nStill, with the health care issue resolved one way or another next year, Mr. Peters predicted a return to normal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I would be surprised if next year the State of the Union is in February,\" he said. \"I would expect it to be right around middle to late January.\"\n</p>\n\n\n\n",

"story": "\n\n\n\n<p>\nChina conducted a successful test Monday of a missile-defense interceptor, revealing for the first time its development of an anti-missile system, something Beijing has criticized the United States for doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency stated in a three-sentence dispatch that the test of \"ground-based, midcourse missile interception technology\" was carried out \"within its territory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The test has achieved the expected objective,\" the report said, noting that it was \"defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country.\" No other details of the test were released.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRick Fisher, a specialist on the Chinese military, said the announcement of the missile-defense test was unusual since China conducts missile tests on a weekly basis but rarely publicizes them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The big news here is that they are actually reporting, however brief, on a missile test,\" Mr. Fisher said. \"This appears to be a new trend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn recent days, Beijing has stepped up rhetoric denouncing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, including Raytheon Co.'s sale of Patriot missile-defense systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChina's government also has frequently criticized U.S. missile-defense development and, along with Russia, has sought to restrict missile defenses in United Nations forums.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told a U.N. disarmament conference in August that \"countries should neither develop missile-defense systems that undermine global strategic stability nor deploy weapons in outer space.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Fisher, with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, said a recent published report by a senior Chinese military officer outlining China's aerospace doctrine made clear that \"the air force will be developing a missile-defense mission.\" The missile-defense program is part of a military unit called Second Artillery Corps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Fisher, who has written reports on Chinese missile defenses, said he thinks China will deploy a substantial nationwide missile-defense system by the mid-2020s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This will constitute the ultimate irony and face slap given China's very loud and vocal opposition to U.S. missile defenses in late 1990s and early this decade,\" Mr. Fisher said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAsked about China's test and its past opposition to U.S. missile defenses, Chinese Embassy spokeswoman Xi Yanchun repeated that \"so far, I know that the test is defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMark Stokes, a former Air Force officer and specialist on the Chinese military, said China has been investing resources for missile-defense technologies and ground-based space surveillance since the late 1980s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's unclear how sophisticated the test was or what was used as a target,\" said Mr. Stokes, with Project 2049 Institute, a research group.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, he noted that \"there's likely a linkage between China's anti-satellite and missile-defense interceptor programs\" because both use similar technology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Stokes said China's complaints about U.S. missile-defense sales to Taiwan are dubious considering Beijing's large-scale conventional ballistic missile buildup against Taiwan. More than 1,000 missiles are now deployed near Taiwan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If authorities in Beijing find the sale of U.S. missile defenses to Taiwan to be against China's interests, maybe political authorities in Beijing should reduce the missile threat,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn January 2007, China fired a ground-based missile into space and successfully destroyed a weather satellite. This anti-satellite system, which remains couched in secrecy, could be adapted by China for a nationwide anti-ballistic-missile system, Mr. Fisher said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Pentagon's latest annual report to Congress on China's military, released last spring, made no mention of Beijing's development of missile defenses, despite providing details on an array of new Chinese weapons, including missiles, submarines, aircraft and cyberwarfare capabilities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe announcement of the missile-defense test also coincided with a Xinhua report warning that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are harming U.S.-Chinese relations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Pentagon announced a $970 million contract to sell Patriot PAC-3 missiles to Taiwan in a Jan. 6 statement. The Xinhua report noted that the contract with Lockheed Martin Corp. was part of an arms package first approved by President Bush's administration in October 2008.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Profound lessons should be drawn from history,\" the report said. \"All previous U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have caused great damage to the Sino-U.S. relations and blocked their stable and smooth development.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChina cut off military relations with the Pentagon after the October 2008 arms package to Taiwan was announced, although Beijing has been gradually resuming military ties.\n</p>\n\n",

"story": "\n\n<p>\nA major Jewish organization accused several Muslim groups on Monday of using an Islamic summit in Chicago as a platform for extremist and anti-Semitic invective instead of its stated purpose to combat the increasing radicalization of Muslim-American youths.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBased on transcripts or tapes obtained from a Dec. 23-27 convocation of the Muslim American Society (MAS) and the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) meeting at a Hyatt hotel downtown, the Anti-Defamation League said the gathering \"served as a forum for religious scholars and political activists to rail against Jews, call for the eradication of the state of Israel and accuse the United States government as waging a war against Muslims at home and abroad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe conference, which was the eighth annual gathering for the two groups, was a \"sham,\" the ADL said, in terms of its stated intent to combat the increasing involvement of young Muslims in terrorism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is shocking that this conference, identified by some major Muslim-American groups as the venue to start the process of reform at a time of growing attacks and threats by American Muslim extremists, was a sham and nothing more than a cover for the dissemination of hateful anti-American and anti-Israel views and anti-Semitism,\" said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs advertised on mahdibray.net, the conference added a workshop for disenfranchised Muslim youths to interact with about 20 older Islamic scholars after five young American Muslims were arrested in Pakistan last month for connecting with extremist Islamic groups.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nImam Mahdi Bray, executive director of MAS Freedom, had posted a statement saying that the conference would \"focus on positive solutions involving issues of hate, violence and intolerance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Bray agreed that some remarks at the conference &#8212; which had 4,000 attendees and 100 speakers &#8212; were \"over the top\" and that he had complained to the chairman of one session. But he said his group denounced any such statements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We take any attack on the Jewish community or anti-Semitism as serious,\" the imam said. \"If there were any speakers who were anti-Semitic, they were totally rejected by us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ADL said the conference provided cover for anti-Semitic rants. It said that Rafiq Jaber, former president of the Islamic Association of Palestine, described Jews to the audience as \"the worst kind of people,\" who came to Jerusalem \"with false pretenses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ADL cited Hamed Ghazali, chairman of the MAS Council of Islamic Schools and professor at the Islamic American University in Michigan, as telling the audience in Arabic that \"Allah gave us the Jews\" as the primary historical and religious example of those who \"take the wrong path.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOther speakers &#8212; specifically Egyptian Sheik Raghib Al Serjani &#8212; argued that the eradication of the state of Israel is a religious duty, the ADL said.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nMaterials sold at the convention, the ADL said, included books and CDs by anti-Semitic sheiks such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a leading Muslim Brotherhood leader based in Qatar who is known for terrorist connections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnother radical cleric whose wares were available at the conference was Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born Muslim cleric who has encouraged American Muslims to wage jihad against the U.S. He has been tied to Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of trying to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mr. Bray said the conference's program committee disinvited two radical Islamist speakers &#8212; one an Egyptian and the other a Palestinian &#8212; he called Mr. Foxman's use of the word \"sham\" as \"totally inaccurate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We brought in 700 youth from across the country to refute the views held by al-Awlaki,\" Mr. Bray said. \"The ADL didn't mention our interfaith program either. As for the books and materials, we had a bazaar with 300 vendors. There was no way we could police everything that was published there just as the ADL would not be able to stop groups at one of their conferences from posting Islamophobic materials.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNevertheless, he said Monday afternoon, he was drafting a letter to Mr. Foxman inviting him to a face-to-face meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We hope they will meet,\" he said. \"We have good relationships with other Jewish organizations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNaeem Baig, a spokesman for Jamaica, N.Y.-based ICNA, said he was not at the four-day gathering and could not comment on the speakers, but \"our organization condemns all kinds of extremism and fanaticism and all kinds of hate.\"\n</p>\n\n",

"story": "\n\n<p>\nIn 2007, a high-ranking Navy doctor sent a sobering warning to colleagues: The service may be discharging soldiers for misconduct when in fact they are merely displaying symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy doing so, the anonymous doctor noted in a memo to other medical administrators, the service may be denying those troops their rights to Veterans Affairs benefits &#8212; including treatment for medical conditions they incurred while serving on the battlefield.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nIn the future, any military personnel facing dismissal for misconduct after a deployment should be screened first for PTSD, the memo said. The recommendation was never implemented.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHigh-ranking Navy doctors who oversee medical care for the Marines say such screenings would help avoid sending troops back into society without the ability to get treatment for combat-induced illness from the very government that dispatched them to the battlefield.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Post-deployment misconduct, especially in a Marine who has previously served honorably, may indicate an unrecognized and unhealed line-of-duty stress injury that deserves expeditious medical evaluation and, when indicated, appropriate treatment,\" said the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThe Pentagon confirmed the memo's authenticity, but could provide no further information on the author or the names of the recipients. Veterans' mental health issues have come under increasing scrutiny during the years of the war on terrorism. The latest example is Monday's release of a government study showing a dramatic increase in suicides among young veterans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe PTSD memo also warned, \"If adjudication of misconduct charges results in a less-than-honorable discharge, the Marine may lose eligibility for ongoing treatment in the Veterans Administration health care system.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe memo recommended that screening for all troops facing misconduct discharges be implemented by May 1, 2007, but that recommendation was never followed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is not a formal process or directive that I am aware of where [troops discharged for misconduct] must be screened,\" The Times was told by Frederick \"Fritz\" Kass, the director of clinical programs for the Marine Corps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Kass said the document raises the issue of \"service members who are given adverse separation discharges who are at risk of not being eligible for treatment in the VA system.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears it was to make others aware of that as they move forward,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Problems continue</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Pentagon's ability to diagnose and care for its own has come under renewed scrutiny since May 11, when, authorities say, Army Sgt. John Russell killed five fellow soldiers at a stress clinic in Iraq.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSgt. Russell's father has said his son, who served three tours in Iraq, feared that he was being ousted from the military after being sent to the clinic by a commanding officer with whom he had fought and was told to surrender his gun.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo one knows how many more Sgt. Russells are out there, or how many have been discharged for misconduct, but two sets of statistics hint at the potential scale of the problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Army told The Washington Times that 27,973 troops from that branch alone have been dismissed from service on punitive discharges from October 2002, the start of fiscal 2003 and just before the Iraq war began, to May 2009. Close to half &#8212; almost 12,700 &#8212; were ousted in fiscal 2003.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA good portion of those who have seen combat duty can be expected to have PTSD. The 2008 Rand Corp. study, which found that one in every five Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffers from PTSD or major depression, also determined that rates of PTSD were highest in the Army and the Marines and that 45 percent of those surveyed said they had seen dead or seriously injured noncombatants.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>What's being done</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of the soldiers is Special Operations Command Sgt. Adam Boyle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSgt. Boyle was thrown out of the Army because of a \"pattern of misconduct,\" even though he had been diagnosed with PTSD. As a combat veteran who served two tours in Iraq, Sgt. Boyle began experiencing intense pangs of guilt and anger and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder at a stress clinic in Iraq.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was always in the field before then,\" he recalled. \"I did everything you can imagine from patrols to raids to capturing enemy POWs, interrogations, reconnaissance by fire. Everything you can imagine that put me in harm's way, and I was OK with it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bad feelings began to set in after two of his buddies were killed, one of them newly married with a child. \"Those deaths haunted me, the idea of their families back home without them,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter his diagnosis, Sgt. Boyle was sent to North Carolina's Fort Bragg, an assignment he resented because he thought he should be fighting the war. At Fort Bragg, he was given heavy antidepressants and sleeping aids that he said caused him to oversleep and miss formation on several occasions, a major transgression in the military.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wanted to return to Iraq to fight, but the medications barred him from more deployments and he became miserable and agitated. Sgt. Boyle went on to spar with commanding officers who, he said, were unaware of his combat experience. He drank heavily, couldn't control his rage and ended up in trouble with the law.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe reached the tipping point when he experienced a flashback while supervising a session at the firing range at Fort Bragg.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was supposed to be keeping an eye on [the soldiers], keep them safe and doing the right thing,\" Sgt. Boyle recalled. \"At one point, I went into a flashback into a firefight, and I was in Iraq. And during that flashback, I zoned out and forgot what I was doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I snapped out of it and realized I missed the whole firing sequence, and it scared the hell out of me. I can't operate as a soldier if I can't concentrate on a firing range like that. That helped me realize I had to get out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that point, in consultation with his psychiatrist, Sgt. Boyle began seeking a medical discharge based on his PTSD. But the process was slow; he was allotted only one hour per month with his psychiatrist to plan proceedings and receive counseling for his existing problems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSome of those problems were documented in a domestic violence complaint filed by a former girlfriend who said Sgt. Boyle assaulted her, although she never brought charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"His command has been contacted numerous times by myself and friends trying to get Adam's behavior under control,\" she said in the complaint. \"I would like to see him get serious help and be removed from anyone else he could cause harm to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSgt. Boyle became so intoxicated and disorderly during a weekend getaway that police were called. When they attempted to restrain him, he fought back. \"I wrestled with the cops,\" Sgt. Boyle said. \"I don't know if it's part of my Iraq issues or not, but I couldn't handle being restrained.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA judge ultimately dismissed the charges, but Sgt. Boyle said that incident was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" for the Army, which found his behavior unacceptable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEven though he was being considered for medical discharge, he was ousted with a general discharge based on misconduct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Boyle demonstrated a repetitive pattern of misconduct in civil jurisdictions,\" Carol Darby, chief of media and community relations for the Army's Special Operations Command, said about Sgt. Boyle's dismissal. \"During that same time frame, he was actively receiving medical attention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nowhere in our four major criteria for PTSD does it allow for breaking the law,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSgt. Boyle said he was scheduled to receive a general discharge with \"other-than-honorable\" conditions, but has been fighting to have it changed to \"under honorable conditions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStill, the general discharge isn't as good as an \"honorable discharge\" or \"medical discharge,\" which would guarantee him access to medical and compensation benefits. He also must repay the Army the $18,500 enlistment bonus he received for signing up for his second tour of duty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawyer Jason Perry has taken on Sgt. Boyle's case pro bono and is working to have the dismissal upgraded to a medical discharge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nVeterans Affairs does provide some counseling services for Sgt. Boyle, but the burden is on him to prove that his injuries were combat-induced. He will be able to access medical care much more easily if Mr. Perry succeeds in having his discharge upgraded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Ominous prediction</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nVeterans' advocate and lawyer Carissa Picard has been on a one-woman mission to raise awareness about troops being ousted from service as a result of deployment-induced mental health issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rather than treating that soldier as if they are treating him [for] a war injury, they treat that soldier with derision,\" Ms. Picard said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got a bad feeling after reading in September 2008 that post-deployment soldier Spc. Jody Michael Wirawan had fatally shot his commanding officer and then turned his gun on himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If we are going to continue to engage in these prolonged military conflicts overseas, then mental health care has to be made a priority,\" she said in a posting to Bloggernews.com. \"It has to be generously funded by Congress and aggressively utilized by the Department of Defense. If we don't, then this won't be the last time you will read a headline like this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer grim prediction was borne out eight months later when Sgt. Russell opened fire on fellow soldiers at a stress clinic in Iraq.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nWhen asked what he thought of Sgt. Russell's crimes, Sgt. Boyle said, \"I know exactly what's going on. There's been more than a few times I had very unpleasant thoughts dealing with the chain of command.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Putting myself in that position, dealing with what I was dealing with at Fort Bragg, if I took that scenario and moved it to Iraq, I can't imagine what that situation would be like. That's a scary thought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSgt. Boyle added: \"Good soldiers shouldn't have to go through that, especially if they are out in Iraq risking their lives and then to expect there's not going to be ramifications. That's like taking a good dog and beating it constantly, and it bites you, and you don't understand why.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Not alone</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBart Stichman, co-executive director of the National Veterans Legal Services Program, said his office sees \"a certain number of cases\" in which the military has failed to properly discern between PTSD and misconduct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We have clients that fall into that pattern,\" Mr. Stichman said. \"They have PTSD, and they don't get adequate treatment, and when they don't get treatment they act out. They use drugs or alcohol, and the military discharges them for misconduct.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Stichman added that this presumes that the military perfectly diagnoses PTSD, a disorder that can be difficult to discern. In the meantime, any untreated service member still shows the symptoms, including acting out in ways that can lead to misconduct and other legal charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is a subset of that, based on a subjective judgment,\" Mr. Stichman said of his PTSD cases. \"You and I could look at a case and say this misconduct is due to a mental disorder, and someone else will say, 'Sure, he had a mental disorder, but his misconduct wasn't due to his mental disorder.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>What's being done</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe government took aggressive action to diagnose and treat veterans suffering from PTSD in 2007 after a flurry of studies, recommendations and reports addressing veterans' care, including the bipartisan commission to investigate Walter Reed Army Medical Center, led by former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn Monday, the Veterans Affairs Department released preliminary data showing that the suicide rate of young veterans, most of whom likely served in Iraq or Afghanistan, has risen by more than one-fourth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe suicide rate among 18- to 29-year-old men who have left active military duty rose from 44.99 suicides per 100,000 men in 2005 to 56.77 in 2007, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures taken from 16 states.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe active military is seeing the same problem, with the Army cataloging a record number of suicides last year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do we know so much about suicides but still know so little about how to prevent them?\" VA Secretary Eric Shinseki told a suicide prevention conference Monday in Washington, according to wire service reports. \"Simple question, but we continue to be challenged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAmong the many centers that address mental health issues are the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, the Center for Deployment Psychology, the Deployment Health Clinical Center, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence that's scheduled to open later this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYet those centers won't necessarily benefit military personnel like Sgt. Boyle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Instead of being honorably retired, he's now an ex-soldier with a general discharge and no guaranteed access to health care or treatment,\" said his attorney, Mr. Perry.\n</p>\n\n",

"story": "\n\n<p>\nIt's a scenario repeated thousands of times in the past 30 years: A young, poor, pregnant woman agrees to have a nurse visit her in her home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe nurse talks about good nutrition, giving up cigarettes and preparing for childbirth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter the baby is born and for two more years, the nurse visits once or twice a month to help the young mother cope with the daily demands of a growing child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis maternal home-visit service is on its way to becoming a massive federal program, thanks to President Obama and his administration's push for health care reform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut, as with any grass-roots approach that burgeons into a federal program, criticisms emerge. Concerns with this home-visit program range from its likely $1 billion price tag to the idea of Uncle Sam doing \"in-home family planning\" in poor neighborhoods.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a candidate, Mr. Obama touted the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), founded in the late 1970s by psychologist David Olds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This program saves money,\" Mr. Obama said in 2007. \"It raises healthy babies and creates better parents. It reduced childhood injuries and unintended pregnancies, increased father involvement and women's employment, reduced use of welfare and food stamps, and increased children's school readiness. And it produced more than $28,000 in net savings for every high-risk family enrolled in the program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will expand the Nurse-Family Partnership to provide at-home nurse visits for up to 570,000 first-time mothers each year,\" Mr. Obama promised. \"We can do this. Our God is big enough for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Obama administration kept its word. Its first budget called for a home-visitation program for new mothers costing $8.6 billion over 10 years. The home-visit program is now embedded in health care reform, costing $750 million over five years in the House bill and $1.5 billion in the Senate bill. The bills are being merged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Denver-based NFP has many supporters, including nine major foundations. Twenty-eight states use NFP, with almost 20,000 families enrolled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, the home visit program is viewed with suspicion in some quarters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe House Republican Conference initially derided the House provision for its \"billions for babysitters,\" but seems to have backed off that claim, reportedly because of some Republicans' support for NFP.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOther critics are animated by the specter of a \"nanny state\" and displacement of parental rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe program could increase \"matriarchal dominance\" in poor neighborhoods already awash with absent-father homes, said Gordon E. Finley, a psychology professor at Florida International University who writes on gender roles.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nMost nurses are women, he said, so it would mean more women advising women, without necessarily considering the fathers. And because nursing is a female-dominated sector, the program means more jobs for women, but not men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe program may bring \"biases of the medical community into the home,\" said E. Christian Brugger, an ethicist and senior fellow at Culture of Life Foundation. The medical community, for instance, has a bias against large families - women in maternity wards who have delivered a second child are \"routinely asked\" whether they want to be sterilized, he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe House bill also stipulates that home-visiting professionals will, when appropriate, \"provide referrals to other programs serving children and families.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Given the pro-abortion biases of the administration pushing this reform and of like-minded members of the health care industry, it is highly likely that such referrals will routinely include &#8230; Planned Parenthood and other abortion-providing institutions,\" Mr. Brugger said. \"This is a serious concern to all who oppose the federal government getting involved in the counseling, referring or funding of abortions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe House bill's goal of home visits \"increasing birth intervals between pregnancies\" alarms James Harden, president and chief executive of CompassCare Pregnancy Services in Rochester, N.Y.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Increasing birth intervals' is a very loaded phrase, and where it goes in the future, no one can know,\" Mr. Harden said. \"What is the birth interval? Is it two years between children? Three years between children? Five years between two children? From my perspective, [increasing] birth intervals relates to a backdoor approach to population control.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNFP spokesman Julian Kesner strongly disputed such an idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere has been \"no documented situation\" in which a nurse has told a mother to get pregnant or not to get pregnant, he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMothers in one NFP study site did have longer birth intervals (average 28 months) between first and second children, compared with other mothers, but \"that's a byproduct of trying to teach the moms some personal responsibility. &#8230; The vast majority of these pregnancies are unplanned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe program is entirely voluntary, Mr. Kesner added, and when it comes to future pregnancies, the nurses' goal is to get the women to \"think it out better, plan for the future.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeanwhile, a new cautionary note about the NFP appeared last week in a study in the Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine, a publication affiliated with the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe study looked at the 19-year-old children of New York mothers who received home visits from nurses when the children were born.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe daughters of the nurse-visited mothers were less likely to have been in trouble with the law than daughters of mothers who did not get the visits, said Cornell University researcher John Eckenrode and his colleagues. This means NFP \"has the potential to produce lasting changes\" for girls in reducing crime, they wrote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, the nurse-visit program had no effect on the women's sons. Mr. Olds, NFP founder and professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado in Denver, called the gender disparity disappointing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStill, there is great enthusiasm for the NFP and home-visit programs among politicians, academics, child-welfare advocates and the mothers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They always say babies don't come with instruction manuals,\" a Pennsylvania mother named Andrea told NFP, \"but if there was one, the Nurse-Family Partnership program would be it.\"\n</p>\n\n",
