It also recommends refusing residence cards and citizenship to anyone with visible signs of a \"radical religious practice.\"\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nHowever, there is no call to outlaw such garments -- worn by a tiny minority of Muslims -- in private areas and in the street. A full ban was the major issue that divided the 32-member, multiparty panel which ultimately heeded warnings that a full ban risked being deemed unconstitutional and could even cause trouble in a country where Islam is the second-largest religion.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe report, which culminates six months of hearings, was formally presented to the president of the National Assembly, the lower house, Bernard Accoyer, and made public.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nConservative lawmaker Eric Raoult, the panel's No. 2 member, said later that he foresaw a limited ban in the public sector \"before the end of the year.\"\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\n\"We need maybe six months or a little more to explain what we want,\" he told The Associated Press, adding that \"by the end of 2010\" there could be such an interdiction.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nAccoyer was more vague but told a news conference that \"we can certainly find solutions in a brief time.\"\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nUniversities, hospitals, public transport and post offices would be among areas included in a limited ban on the all-encompassing veil.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nAs envisaged by the panel, such a ban would require that people show their faces when entering the facility and \"keep the face uncovered throughout their presence,\" the report says.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nFailure to do so would result \"in a refusal to deliver the service demanded.\" That means, for instance, that a woman seeking state funds commonly accorded to mothers would walk away empty-handed.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nA parliamentary resolution condemning such garb, with no legal weight and the easiest measure to pass, would be likely to precede concrete initiatives.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe veil is widely viewed in France as a gateway to extremism, an insult to gender equality and an offense to France's secular foundation. A 2004 French law bans Muslim headscarves from primary and secondary school classrooms.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe language in the report was carefully chosen in an effort to avoid offending France's estimated 5 million Muslims -- the largest such population in western Europe -- and accusations of discrimination. Muslim leaders have already complained that the debate over the full veil coupled with an ongoing debate on French national identity has left some Muslims feeling their religion is becoming a government target.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe panel went to work, taking testimony from more than 200 experts and others, after President Nicolas Sarkozy said in June that veils that hide the face are \"not welcome\" on French territory.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nSuch veils are thought to be worn by only several thousand Muslim women who, most often, pin a \"niqab\" across their faces, hiding all but the eyes. Worn with a long, dark robe, such clothing is customarily associated with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe report puts an emphasis on educating women who wear the robes in France about the rules of the Republic.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nAny action on the report would not come before March regional elections.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n</story>",

McDonnell has written some of the job-creation plans he unveiled in a speech a week ago into legislation that a Republican, a Democrat and an independent will sponsor.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nMr. McDonnell said in a press release late Monday afternoon that he will boost job-development program spending by about $50 million a year. He said he would offset the spending with cuts, a windfall from the state tax amnesty program, and savings from higher employee contributions to pension plans for new state workers.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nMonday's announcement mostly restated key points the newly inaugurated Republican governor made in his first State of the Commonwealth speech on Jan. 18 to a joint session of the General Assembly.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nAmong other things, the legislation would boost a governor's office fund for luring companies to Virginia by $12 million next year over what Democratic former Gov. Tim Kaine proposed in the budget he submitted last month.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nIt appropriates $2 million to open Virginia trade offices in China, India and the United Kingdom; boosts Virginia Tourism Corp. funding by $3.6 million; and adds $2 million to a fund to entice Hollywood to shoot movies in the state.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nTo pay for it, Mr. McDonnell proposes using $21 million the state netted from its tax amnesty program, savings of about $25 million from a requirement that new state hires pay a share into their pensions, and spending cuts. Many of those measures were in Mr. Kaine's proposed budget.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nState Sens. Chuck Colgan, a Democrat, and William Wampler, a Republican, will be the bill's Senate patrons, and conservative independent Lacey Putney of Bedford, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, will introduce it in the House.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nThe changes are an effort by Mr. McDonnell to make good on the central pledge of his successful gubernatorial campaign: creating jobs at a time when Virginia's unemployment rate has more than doubled to nearly 7 percent. And he has to make the changes as he and the General Assembly reconcile a $4 billion revenue shortfall over the next two years.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\n\"The budget that I have inherited is dire, and it is unbalanced. We begin with nearly a billion dollar annual shortfall based on tax hike proposals that both parties have rejected. More spending cuts must be made,\" Mr. McDonnell said in the release.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nBut it would be even more costly, he reasoned, not to invest now in creating new jobs.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nMr. Kaine's budget may have been dire, and it was unpalatable to Republicans and many Democrats. But it was balanced, chiefly by cutting the $950 million annual cash payment the state made to cities and counties as reimbursement for revenue lost to the 12-year-old phaseout of the local tax on personal automobiles.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nA separate $1 billion-a-year income-tax increase Mr. Kaine proposed would have gone to local governments in return for the discontinued annual reimbursements. That bill, however, died last week in the House, with Democrats and Republicans both voting unanimously to kill it.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nInitial Democratic reaction to Monday's late-day press release was guarded but favorable.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nDelegate Ward L. Armstrong, Henry County Democrat, who is his party's leader in the House of Delegates, said he wasn't troubled that the Senate's senior Democrat was a co-sponsor for the GOP governor's first major budget legislation.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\n\"It gives me some level of comfort,\" Mr. Armstrong said.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nHe agreed with many of the ideas Mr. McDonnell offered, he said, including capturing savings and windfalls and targeted cuts. He was less charitable toward the proposal to boost employee contributions to the Virginia Retirement System.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\n\"You're looking at contributions from state employees, and they haven't had a raise. Clearly it eats into their income if they have to contribute more,\" Mr. Armstrong said.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nMr. Colgan, reached by telephone to discuss the legislation Monday night, said he could not speak and hung up.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\nMr. McDonnell, Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling and other senior administration officials plan to elaborate on the legislative package at a Tuesday news conference. Mr. McDonnell has given Mr. Bolling the duty of acting as the state's \"chief jobs-creation officer\" during his four-year term.\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n<p><![CDATA[\r\n<em>Associated Press writer Larry O'Dell contributed to this report.</em>\r\n]]></p>\r\n\r\n</story>",
